<!-- Hi! I am Chaoda Zheng, a Ph.D. student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ) in the [School of Science and Engineering](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en) and [Future Network of Intelligence Institute (FNII)](https://fnii.cuhk.edu.cn/).
I am currently supervised by [Dr. Zhen Li](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/) and co-supervised by [Shuguang Cui](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/cuishuguang).

My research interests focus on 3D computer vision, including - but not limited to - 3D object detection and tracking, Scene understanding. -->

Hello, I'm Chaoda Zheng, currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ).
I am privileged to conduct my research under the expert supervision of [Dr. Zhen Li](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/lizhen/), and additionally co-supervised by the highly accomplished [Prof. Shuguang Cui](https://sse.cuhk.edu.cn/en/faculty/cuishuguang).
My academic journey is guided by my passion for 3D computer vision, with a specific focus on perception tasks related to Autonomous Driving and Indoor Scene Understanding. However, I don't limit myself to these areas; I am continuously exploring and broadening my knowledge in other related aspects such as neural rendering and multi-modal learning.
